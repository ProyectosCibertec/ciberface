## Project setup
You should have the following stuff installed in your PC:
- MySQL
- Java 11 JDK
- And the code editor or IDE of your preference.

Once you have those programs, execute the SQL command found in `./app/src/main/resources/Database.sql` to create the database. Next, copy the file `./app/src/main/resources/.spring-boot-devtools.properties` into your home directory and make the changes you consider necessary. Finally execute the main method in the `app` module.
